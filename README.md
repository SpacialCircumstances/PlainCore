# PlainCore (v4)

A basic, actually somewhat working 2d graphics rendering library built on top of [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid).

## Features

- Font generation at runtime from TTF files (using [SharpFontCore](https://github.com/SpacialCircumstances/SharpFont))
- Batched rendering of both sprites and text
- Scissoring
- Basic viewport support
- Lots of bugs, especially on non-Windows systems or when using a backend other than DirectX and Vulkan
